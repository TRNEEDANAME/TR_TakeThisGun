# Take This

This mod was requested by Endlesspie49 to do a simple task, port back the "You'll need this" ability back to standard WOTC
It devolved into madness, lots of madness

## Features
- The ability is now fully configurable, AP cost, charges, stat changes and such are all in `XcomTR_TakeThis.ini`
- Ability to grant extra stats, abilities and even random abilities from a list of your choosing
- Automatically grant the ability to a list of predefined classes
- Full tier support, no more giving a conventional pistol when you have a beam pistol ! It now uses the unit's current pistol tech level (include full 5TWO / LWOTC support)
- Create your own abilities !
  - Using config you can now create your own "You'll need this" abilities, including but not limited to :
    - Ability name, AP cost, icon, description
    - Stats value and other stats to change
    - Charges (with an abilities list that grant bonus charges per ability)
    - Target condition
    - Weapon name to give (with the standard abilities if the gun doesn't give them)
    - Wether to use 5 tier or not
    - Random abilities to give (boolean to make it disabled)
    - Classes to give the ability to
    - The mod includes some default icons, made by Endlesspie49
        - They  include : most primairy and secondary weapons icons, in the same style as the original ability

## Credits
- The LW2 / LWOTC teams, for making / porting the ability, effect and icon
- Boudir for making the "Create Immunities" mod, which was how the ability creation became possible
- Endlesspie49 for giving me the original idea, making the icons and testing the mod
